Warlock Wars - Game Design Document
Warlock Wars is a multiplayer card battle game developed in Godot 4.4 with Steamworks P2P networking. Up to 12 players compete to reduce their opponents’ HP to zero or achieve special victory conditions using a variety of cards and strategic mechanics. Set in a narrative where an arch-lich has unleashed a contest of power, players take on the roles of wizards or sorceresses vying to become the next Arch Magus.
Objective

	Be the last player standing by reducing all opponents’ HP to 0 or surviving until the end of the game via special win conditions (e.g., Holy-attribute damage or "Divine Wrath").

Setup

	Players: Supports 2 to 12 players (multiplayer, online).
	Starting Stats:
		Vigor: Starts at 20 (health pool, varies slightly by mode).
		Arcane Flux: Starts at 10 (used to cast Spell Cards).
		Treasure ($): Starts at 20 (used for trading or card effects).
	Deck: Players draw 9 cards randomly from a shared pool at the start. No personal deck-building; all cards are drawn from the same set.
	Card Limit: Maximum hand size is 18. Excess cards (e.g., from forced transfers) result in random discards.
	Mulligan Option: At the game’s start, players may discard their initial hand and redraw 9 new cards once.

Gameplay Overview

	Turn-Based: Players act in clockwise order (or as set by the online system).
	Turn Structure: Perform actions (attack, defend, use cards), then draw to replenish hand up to 9 cards at turn’s end.
	Victory Conditions:
		Reduce all opponents’ HP to 0.
		Deal 1+ damage with a Holy-attribute attack under specific conditions (varies by version).
		Trigger "Divine Wrath" (instant-death effect).

Elements

	Non-element (NE): Defendable by any element.
	Fire: Defended by Water.
	Water: Defended by Fire.
	Earth: Blocked by Air.
	Air: Blocked by Earth.
	Holy: Cannot be defended by any element.
	Necromancy: Applies or worsens a Curse status instead of insta-killing; damage taken triggers Curse mechanics (see below).
	Mixed Elements: Combining different elements results in Non-element (NE).
	Holy Substitution: Holy can substitute for Fire, Water, Earth, or Air, but not Necromancy.

Curses

	Acquisition: Taking Necromancy-type damage applies a Curse or worsens an existing one (5% chance per turn to escalate).
	Progression:
		Life Steal: 1 damage per turn, 5% chance to worsen to Life Drain.
		Life Drain: 2 damage per turn, 5% chance to worsen to Undeath.
		Undeath: 5 damage per turn, 5% chance to worsen to Lich.
		Lich: +5 Vigor per turn, 5% chance to worsen to Divine Wrath (Vigor to 0).
		Divine Wrath: Instant HP reduction to 0.
	Lich Special Rules:
		Necromancy damage heals instead of harms.
		Holy damage deals double damage (critical hit).
		Potential card: "Lich Shield" (blocks Divine Wrath once, single-use).
	Other Curses:
		Darkness: Randomizes attack targets.
		Dispel: Limits player to one attack or defense card per turn.
		Chaos Surge: 50% chance for cards to display incorrect info.
		Marked: Received attacks hit with 100% accuracy.
		Charmed: Hidden from the cursed player; remaps two targets (chosen by caster), ends when one is attacked.
		Illusion: Negates the next damage instance (self-only visibility), lost after next attack.

Card Types

	Cantrips (攻):
		Deal damage (e.g., "Arcane Bolt," 14 ATK).
		Limited to 1 attack per turn unless combined with combo cards (e.g., "+X ATK").
		Some have unique effects (e.g., reflecting damage).
	Abjuration (守):
		Block damage (e.g., "Circle of Protection," 5 DEF).
		Unlimited stacking allowed when defending.
		Damage taken = Attack value - Total Defense value (minimum 0).
	Magic Items:
		Effects include healing Vigor, restoring Arcane Flux, AOE damage, forcing card trades ("Sell"), or removing curses.
		Example: "Illustrious Gem" (1 ATK, 25 Gold cost, often traded).
	Spell Cards:
		Cost Arcane Flux for powerful, reusable effects (e.g., "Invisibility" for 6 Flux).
		Mimic attack, defense, or utility roles.
	Deck Manipulation Cards:
		Allow peeking at the top X cards of the draw pile or reordering them (e.g., "Scry: Look at top 3 cards, reorder as desired").

Special Card Subsets

	Summon Cards:
		Attach to a player after use (via Magic Items or Spells).
		Have HP; take damage before Equipment if unblocked (unless attack specifies otherwise).
		Act independently 25% of the time on the player’s turn with unique abilities.
		Detach and "die" when HP reaches 0.
		Example: "Iron Golem" (lowers incoming damage by 10 while active).
	Curse Cards:
		Auto-activate when drawn:
			Deal 10, 20, or 30 damage to the drawer.
			"Trickster": Steals 3 cards.
			"Elixir of Life": Grants 10 HP, Flux, and Gold.
	Equipment Cards:
		Attach to a player, providing buffs/debuffs.
		Have HP; take damage after Summons if unblocked.
		Detach and "shatter" when HP reaches 0.
	Wish Cards:
		Triggered by "Warlock Wars" card, applying random global effects (e.g., field-wide damage or stat changes).

Core Mechanics

	Attacking and Defending:
		Select an opponent and play a Cantrip. They respond with Abjuration cards. Excess damage (ATK - DEF) reduces HP.
		Combo attack cards (e.g., "+3 ATK") boost base attacks.
	Card Usage Limits:
		1 attack action per turn (unless modified).
		Unlimited defense cards when attacked.
		Spell and Magic Item cards have specific costs/conditions.
	Drawing Cards:
		Replenish to 9 cards (max 18) at turn’s end from the shared pool.
	Stat Management:
		Freely redistribute Vigor, Arcane Flux, and Treasure (1:1:1 ratio).
	Special Actions:
		Sacrifice: Discard cards and draw an equal number.
		Sell: Force an opponent to take a card (random discard if hand exceeds 18).
		Buy: Spend Treasure to take a random card from another player’s hand.

Winning and Losing

	Standard Win: Reduce all opponents’ HP to 0; last player standing wins.
	Special Wins:
		Deal 1+ Holy damage under specific conditions.
		Trigger "Divine Wrath" via Curse progression.
	Loss: HP reaches 0, eliminating the player.

Additional Rules

	Randomness (RNG): Card draws, Summon actions, and Curse progression rely on chance for unpredictability.
	Multiplayer Dynamics: In 3+ player games, choose targets each turn, enabling alliances or chaos.
	Online Features:
		Steamworks P2P networking for seamless multiplayer.
		Bot matches and ranked modes available.
		Cosmetic Rewards: Players unlock alt skins, shiny rare card versions (with unique animations/FX), and card backs as Steam inventory items. Earned by:
